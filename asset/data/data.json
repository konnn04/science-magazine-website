Interventions that promote academic persistence also work differently for students from different backgrounds and operate differently across contexts. Walton et al. conducted a randomized controlled trial to systematically explain and understand these heterogenous effects in a brief online intervention across 22 universities and colleges (see the Perspective by Bowman). The intervention was designed to remedy students’ concerns about belonging through a reading-and-writing activity that emphasized how worries about fitting in, struggling in class, and feeling homesick during the college transition are common and improve over time. They found that the intervention improved retention and persistence in school, particularly among historically underrepresented students, when the school context offered students opportunities to belong. The findings have policy implications for academic institutions that strive to better support and retain diverse students. —Ekeoma Uzogara",

Here we report a team-science randomized controlled experiment with 26,911 students at 22 diverse institutions. Results showed that the social-belonging intervention, administered online before college (in under 30 minutes), increased the rate at which students completed the first year as full-time students, especially among students in groups that had historically progressed at lower rates. The college context also mattered: The intervention was effective only when students’ groups were afforded opportunities to belong. This study develops methods for understanding how student identities and contexts interact with interventions. It also shows that a low-cost, scalable intervention generalizes its effects to 749 4-year institutions in the United States.",

Feedback processes such as supernova explosions enrich the gas with elements heavier than helium and can impart enough momentum to eject some gas out of the galaxy. S. Zhang et al. observed the intergalactic medium around a massive galaxy at redshift 2.3. In addition to emission lines caused by hydrogen and helium, they observed lines for carbon, indicating that the gas has been enriched with heavier elements. The kinematics are consistent with streams of gas spiraling toward the massive galaxy. The authors propose that the enriched gas has been recycled from an earlier period of star formation. —Keith T. Smith",
                "abstract":"Stars form in galaxies, from gas that has been accreted from the intergalactic medium. Simulations have shown that recycling of gas—the reaccretion of gas that was previously ejected from a galaxy—could sustain star formation in the early Universe. We observe the gas surrounding a massive galaxy at redshift 2.3 and detect emission lines from neutral hydrogen, helium, and ionized carbon that extend 100 kiloparsecs from the galaxy. The kinematics of this circumgalactic gas is consistent with an inspiraling stream. The carbon abundance indicates that the gas had already been enriched with elements heavier than helium, previously ejected from a galaxy. We interpret the results as evidence of gas recycling during high-redshift galaxy assembly.",

Holycross and Cottrell tested this hypothesis by running a series of experiments to determine how garnet formation changes the amount and speciation of iron. They found that garnet does not have a large impact and is unlikely to be the sole cause of the oxidation of arc lavas. The observed chemistry requires a different explanation. —Brent Grocholski",
                "abstract":"Arc magmas, the building blocks of continental crust, are depleted in total iron (Fe), have higher ratios of oxidized Fe to total Fe (Fe3+/∑Fe), and record higher oxygen fugacities (fO2’s) compared with magmas erupted at mid-ocean ridges. Garnet crystallization could explain these observations if garnet removes substantial amounts of Fe<sip>2+</sup>,, but not Fe<sup>3+</sup>, from magma, yet this model for continental crust generation has never been tested experimentally. Analysis of garnets and melts in laboratory experiments show that the compatibilities of Fe<sip>2+</sup> and Fe<sip>3+</sup> in garnet are of similar magnitudes. Our results indicate that fractional crystallization of garnet-bearing cumulates will remove 22 % of total Fe from primary arc basalts but negligibly alter the Fe<sip>3+</sup>/∑Fe ratio and fO2 of the melt. Garnet crystallization is unlikely to be responsible for the relatively oxidized nature of basaltic arc magmas or the Fe-depletion trend observed in continental crust.",

In an artificial spin ice geometry called Santa Fe ice, this frustration can be viewed through the magnetic moment configurations at the vertices of the magnetic array. X. Zhang et al. monitored the kinetics of the strings formed by “unhappy” vertices—those not in their lowest energy state. Using x-ray magnetic circular dichroism photoemission electron microscopy, the researchers took images of the system once a second and analyzed the observed changes in string configurations. The system underwent a crossover between a low-temperature regime with limited string motion to a high-temperature one characterized by changes in string topology. —Jelena Stajic",
                "abstract":"Ergodic kinetics, which are critical to equilibrium thermodynamics, can be constrained by a system’s topology. We studied a model nanomagnetic array in which such constraints visibly affect the behavior of the magnetic moments. In this system, magnetic excitations connect into thermally active one-dimensional strings whose motion can be imaged in real time. At high temperatures, our data showed the merging, breaking, and reconnecting of strings, resulting in the system transitioning between topologically distinct configurations. Below a crossover temperature, the string motion is dominated by simple changes in length and shape. In this low-temperature regime, the system is energetically stable because of its inability to explore all possible topological configurations. This kinetic crossover suggests a generalizable conception of topologically broken ergodicity and limited equilibration.",

To reveal which factor is responsible for this process and to understand the molecular mechanism of stop codon recognition, Saurer et al. used a combination of gene editing, ribosomal profiling and cryo–electron microscopy to investigate the termination process in vivo and in vitro. The specific recognition of the noncanonical stop codon by the identified release factor results in a distortion of the messenger RNA and requires participation of the ribosomal RNA, a recognition mechanism that was not observed for canonical termination complexes. —Di Jiang",

Mitochondrial genomes feature deviations from the standard genetic code, including the reassignment of two arginine codons to stop codons. The protein required for translation termination at these noncanonical stop codons to release the newly synthesized polypeptides is not currently known. In this study, we used gene editing and ribosomal profiling in combination with cryo–electron microscopy to establish that mitochondrial release factor 1 (mtRF1) detects noncanonical stop codons in human mitochondria by a previously unknown mechanism of codon recognition. We discovered that binding of mtRF1 to the decoding center of the ribosome stabilizes a highly unusual conformation in the messenger RNA in which the ribosomal RNA participates in specific recognition of the noncanonical stop codons.",

Interventions that promote academic persistence also work differently for students from different backgrounds and operate differently across contexts. Walton et al. conducted a randomized controlled trial to systematically explain and understand these heterogenous effects in a brief online intervention across 22 universities and colleges (see the Perspective by Bowman). The intervention was designed to remedy students’ concerns about belonging through a reading-and-writing activity that emphasized how worries about fitting in, struggling in class, and feeling homesick during the college transition are common and improve over time. They found that the intervention improved retention and persistence in school, particularly among historically underrepresented students, when the school context offered students opportunities to belong. The findings have policy implications for academic institutions that strive to better support and retain diverse students. —Ekeoma Uzogara",

Here we report a team-science randomized controlled experiment with 26,911 students at 22 diverse institutions. Results showed that the social-belonging intervention, administered online before college (in under 30 minutes), increased the rate at which students completed the first year as full-time students, especially among students in groups that had historically progressed at lower rates. The college context also mattered: The intervention was effective only when students’ groups were afforded opportunities to belong. This study develops methods for understanding how student identities and contexts interact with interventions. It also shows that a low-cost, scalable intervention generalizes its effects to 749 4-year institutions in the United States.",

                "summary":"Large areas of the world’s surface ocean contain limited concentrations of iron, most of which is supplied by upwelling of deeper, nutrient-rich water or atmospheric deposition. Bonnet et al. found that shallow hydrothermal sources also can supply iron to the surface ocean. They show that fluids emitted along the Tonga volcanic Arc in the South Pacific supply enough iron to the photic layer to stimulate biological activity well above that in adjacent unfertilized waters. —H. Jesse Smith",
                "abstract":"Iron is an essential nutrient that regulates productivity in ~30% of the ocean. Compared with deep (>2000 meter) hydrothermal activity at mid-ocean ridges that provide iron to the ocean’s interior, shallow (<500 meter) hydrothermal fluids are likely to influence the surface’s ecosystem. However, their effect is unknown. In this work, we show that fluids emitted along the Tonga volcanic arc (South Pacific) have a substantial impact on iron concentrations in the photic layer through vertical diffusion. This enrichment stimulates biological activity, resulting in an extensive patch of chlorophyll (360,000 square kilometers). Diazotroph activity is two to eight times higher and carbon export fluxes are two to three times higher in iron-enriched waters than in adjacent unfertilized waters. Such findings reveal a previously undescribed mechanism of natural iron fertilization in the ocean that fuels regional hotspot sinks for atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>.",

Using high-resolution three-dimensional imaging, Stinchcombe et al. found that T cell receptor (TCR) activation causes rapid membrane specialization at the immune synapse so that membrane containing activated TCRs buds off in a process known as “ectocytosis. ” As ectosomes bud off, CTLs and their target cells separate, allowing serial killing to proceed. Thus, in activated CTLs, ectocytosis renders TCR signaling self-limiting. —Stella M. Hurtley",
                "abstract":"Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) kill virus-infected and cancer cells through T cell receptor (TCR) recognition. How CTLs terminate signaling and disengage to allow serial killing has remained a mystery. TCR activation triggers membrane specialization within the immune synapse, including the production of diacylglycerol (DAG), a lipid that can induce negative membrane curvature. We found that activated TCRs were shed into DAG-enriched ectosomes at the immune synapse rather than internalized through endocytosis, suggesting that DAG may contribute to the outward budding required for ectocytosis. Budding ectosomes were endocytosed directly by target cells, thereby terminating TCR signaling and simultaneously disengaging the CTL from the target cell to allow serial killing. Thus, ectocytosis renders TCR signaling self-limiting.",

                "summary":"Moiré multilayers of graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides have been found to host a number of exotic electronic phases. In addition to charge carriers—electrons and holes—these two-dimensional structures support their pairs, called excitons, which are also expected to form correlated phases. Xiong et al. observed a correlated insulator of interlayer excitons in a bilayer consisting of tungsten diselenide, which hosted holes, and tungsten disulfide, which hosted electrons. The researchers measured the optical response of the material to excitation by light and found signatures of an incompressible state of excitons. —Jelena Stajic",
                "abstract":"A panoply of unconventional electronic states has been observed in moiré superlattices. Engineering similar bosonic phases remains, however, largely unexplored. We report the observation of a bosonic correlated insulator in tungsten diselenide/tungsten disulfide (WSe2/WS2) moiré superlattices composed of excitons, that is, tightly bound electron-hole pairs. We develop a pump probe spectroscopy method that we use to observe an exciton incompressible state at exciton filling νex = 1 and charge neutrality, indicating a correlated insulator of excitons. With varying charge density, the bosonic correlated insulator continuously transitions into an electron correlated insulator at charge filling νe = 1, suggesting a mixed correlated insulating state between the two limits. Our studies establish semiconducting moiré superlattices as an intriguing platform for engineering bosonic phases.",

                "summary":"Biodiversity is typically high in mountain ranges, likely because of their history of tectonic activity and wide range of environments from base to peak. Looking closer, however, reveals that mountain diversity often occurs within environments and in ranges that have long ceased being tectonically active. Stokes et al. describe diversification among lineages of a freshwater fish species in the North American Appalachian Mountains driven by an affiliation with metamorphic rock. Specifically, as metamorphic rock wore away and was replaced by other types, greenfin darters were increasingly isolated in upstream reaches where metamorphic rock remained, leading to population separation and allopatric diversification. —Sacha Vignieri",
                "abstract":"The high levels of biodiversity supported by mountains suggest a possible link between geologic processes and biological evolution. Freshwater biodiversity is high not only in tectonically active settings but also in tectonically quiescent montane regions such as the Appalachian Mountains. We show that erosion through different rock types drove allopatric divergence between lineages of the Greenfin Darter (Nothonotus chlorobranchius), a fish species endemic to rivers draining metamorphic rocks in the Tennessee River basin in the United States. In the past, metamorphic rock preferred by N. chlorobranchius was more widespread, but as erosion exposed other rock types, lineages of this species were progressively isolated in tributaries farther upstream, where metamorphic rock remained. Our results suggest a geologic mechanism for initiating allopatric diversification in mountains long after tectonic activity ceases.",

                "summary":"Aging is associated with physiological changes that range in scale from organelles to organ systems, but we are still working to understand the molecular basis for these changes. Studying various animals, Singh et al. found that the amount of the semi-essential amino acid taurine in circulation decreased with age (see the Perspective by McGaunn and Baur). Supplementation with taurine slowed key markers of aging such as increased DNA damage, telomerase deficiency, impaired mitochondrial function, and cellular senescence. Loss of taurine in humans was associated with aging-related diseases, and concentrations of taurine and its metabolites increased in response to exercise. Taurine supplementation improved life span in mice and health span in monkeys. —L. Bryan Ray",
                "abstract":"Aging is associated with changes in circulating levels of various molecules, some of which remain undefined. We find that concentrations of circulating taurine decline with aging in mice, monkeys, and humans. A reversal of this decline through taurine supplementation increased the health span (the period of healthy living) and life span in mice and health span in monkeys. Mechanistically, taurine reduced cellular senescence, protected against telomerase deficiency, suppressed mitochondrial dysfunction, decreased DNA damage, and attenuated inflammaging. In humans, lower taurine concentrations correlated with several age-related diseases and taurine concentrations increased after acute endurance exercise. Thus, taurine deficiency may be a driver of aging because its reversal increases health span in worms, rodents, and primates and life span in worms and rodents. Clinical trials in humans seem warranted to test whether taurine deficiency might drive aging in humans.",

Fidelle et al. investigated whether bacteria that rebound may affect the treatment response (see the Perspective by Pratt and Milner). Enterocloster species that recolonized the guts of mice treated with antibiotics down-regulated the expression of MAdCAM-1, the ligand for integrin α4β7 that helps to retain an immunosuppressive subset of T cells (Tr17 cells) within the gut. This leads to transit of Tr17 cells to tumors and tumor-draining lymph nodes, where they compromise immune checkpoint blockade therapy. In cancer patients undergoing immunotherapy, low levels of serum-soluble MAdCAM-1 correlated with intestinal dysbiosis and poor clinical outcomes for renal, bladder, and lung tumors. —Priscilla N.

By inducing the down-regulation of mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1) in the ileum, post-ABX gut recolonization by Enterocloster species drove the emigration of enterotropic α4β7+CD4+ regulatory T 17 cells into the tumor. These deleterious ABX effects were mimicked by oral gavage of Enterocloster species, by genetic deficiency, or by antibody-mediated neutralization of MAdCAM-1 and its receptor, α4β7 integrin. By contrast, fecal microbiota transplantation or interleukin-17A neutralization prevented ABX-induced immunosuppression. In independent lung, kidney, and bladder cancer patient cohorts, low serum levels of soluble MAdCAM-1 had a negative prognostic impact. Thus, the MAdCAM-1–α4β7 axis constitutes an actionable gut immune checkpoint in cancer immunosurveillance.",

                "summary":"Nitride-based ferroelectric wurtzites are an emerging family of crystals that are highly attractive as switching materials for modern microelectronics. The chemistry of these materials is a good match for current semiconductor platforms. Calderon et al. used an array of characterization tools to determine exactly how a representative wurtzite composed of aluminum, boron, and nitrogen undergoes polarization switching. A more detailed understanding of this process is vital for lowering the electric field under which these materials switch, because this is a limiting factor in moving them into applications. —Brent Grocholski",
                "abstract":"Ferroelectric wurtzites have the potential to revolutionize modern microelectronics because they are easily integrated with multiple mainstream semiconductor platforms. However, the electric fields required to reverse their polarization direction and unlock electronic and optical functions need substantial reduction for operational compatibility with complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) electronics. To understand this process, we observed and quantified real-time polarization switching of a representative ferroelectric wurtzite (Al<sup>0.94</sup>B<sup>0.06</sup>N) at the atomic scale with scanning transmission electron microscopy. The analysis revealed a polarization reversal model in which puckered aluminum/boron nitride rings in the wurtzite basal planes gradually flatten and adopt a transient nonpolar geometry. Independent first-principles simulations reveal the details and energetics of the reversal process through an antipolar phase. This model and local mechanistic understanding are a critical initial step for property engineering efforts in this emerging material class.",

In an artificial spin ice geometry called Santa Fe ice, this frustration can be viewed through the magnetic moment configurations at the vertices of the magnetic array. X. Zhang et al. monitored the kinetics of the strings formed by “unhappy” vertices—those not in their lowest energy state. Using x-ray magnetic circular dichroism photoemission electron microscopy, the researchers took images of the system once a second and analyzed the observed changes in string configurations. The system underwent a crossover between a low-temperature regime with limited string motion to a high-temperature one characterized by changes in string topology. —Jelena Stajic",
                "abstract":"Ergodic kinetics, which are critical to equilibrium thermodynamics, can be constrained by a system’s topology. We studied a model nanomagnetic array in which such constraints visibly affect the behavior of the magnetic moments. In this system, magnetic excitations connect into thermally active one-dimensional strings whose motion can be imaged in real time. At high temperatures, our data showed the merging, breaking, and reconnecting of strings, resulting in the system transitioning between topologically distinct configurations. Below a crossover temperature, the string motion is dominated by simple changes in length and shape. In this low-temperature regime, the system is energetically stable because of its inability to explore all possible topological configurations. This kinetic crossover suggests a generalizable conception of topologically broken ergodicity and limited equilibration.",

Mitochondrial genomes feature deviations from the standard genetic code, including the reassignment of two arginine codons to stop codons. The protein required for translation termination at these noncanonical stop codons to release the newly synthesized polypeptides is not currently known. In this study, we used gene editing and ribosomal profiling in combination with cryo–electron microscopy to establish that mitochondrial release factor 1 (mtRF1) detects noncanonical stop codons in human mitochondria by a previously unknown mechanism of codon recognition. We discovered that binding of mtRF1 to the decoding center of the ribosome stabilizes a highly unusual conformation in the messenger RNA in which the ribosomal RNA participates in specific recognition of the noncanonical stop codons.",

The team’s array of seafloor electrodes, sensitive to the conductivity of water, captured a subducting seamount that appeared to have a conductive interior covered by a thin resistive crust. That suggested the volcanic rocks inside the seamount were also rich in water, trapped by an impermeable cap, the team concluded. “That stuff is wet and weak,” says Ake Fagereng, a geologist at Cardiff University."

In lab experiments meant to recreate the pressure and heat of the subduction zone, these clays don’t grow stiff enough to lock and rupture in large earthquakes, but could host slow slip, Wallace and her co-authors found in a paper published earlier this year in Science."

Pasteur, who saw hints of this selectivity, or “homochirality,” thought magnetic fields might somehow explain it, but its origin has remained one of biology’s great mysteries.

Researchers led by Matthew Powner and John Sutherland at the University of Manchester were studying possible origins of RNA, which many researchers think was a central player in the origin of life. They were intrigued by a molecule called ribo-aminooxazoline (RAO), which they discovered could react to form two of RNA’s nucleotide building blocks. RAO is among a rare class of crystals that enforce a single chirality: Once a crystal starts to grow from either right- or left-handed versions of the molecule, only molecules with the same chirality can bind to the structure. Such crystals, if they started with an initial bias, could have caused chiral RAO to build up."

When they exposed the magnetite surface to a solution containing an equal mix of right- and left-handed RAO molecules, 60% of those that settled on top were of a single handedness.

                "summary":"The rate of earning university degrees in the United States is very unequal across social class, race, and ethnicity. Interventions that promote academic persistence also work differently for students from different backgrounds and operate differently across contexts. Walton et al. conducted a randomized controlled trial to systematically explain and understand these heterogenous effects in a brief online intervention across 22 universities and colleges (see the Perspective by Bowman). The intervention was designed to remedy students’ concerns about belonging through a reading-and-writing activity that emphasized how worries about fitting in, struggling in class, and feeling homesick during the college transition are common and improve over time. They found that the intervention improved retention and persistence in school, particularly among historically underrepresented students, when the school context offered students opportunities to belong. The findings have policy implications for academic institutions that strive to better support and retain diverse students. —Ekeoma Uzogara",
                "abstract":"A promising way to mitigate inequality is by addressing students’ worries about belonging. But where and with whom is this social-belonging intervention effective? Here we report a team-science randomized controlled experiment with 26,911 students at 22 diverse institutions. Results showed that the social-belonging intervention, administered online before college (in under 30 minutes), increased the rate at which students completed the first year as full-time students, especially among students in groups that had historically progressed at lower rates. The college context also mattered: The intervention was effective only when students’ groups were afforded opportunities to belong. This study develops methods for understanding how student identities and contexts interact with interventions. It also shows that a low-cost, scalable intervention generalizes its effects to 749 4-year institutions in the United States.",

Bonnet et al. found that shallow hydrothermal sources also can supply iron to the surface ocean. They show that fluids emitted along the Tonga volcanic Arc in the South Pacific supply enough iron to the photic layer to stimulate biological activity well above that in adjacent unfertilized waters. —H. Jesse Smith",
                "abstract":"Iron is an essential nutrient that regulates productivity in ~30% of the ocean. Compared with deep (>2000 meter) hydrothermal activity at mid-ocean ridges that provide iron to the ocean’s interior, shallow (<500 meter) hydrothermal fluids are likely to influence the surface’s ecosystem. However, their effect is unknown. In this work, we show that fluids emitted along the Tonga volcanic arc (South Pacific) have a substantial impact on iron concentrations in the photic layer through vertical diffusion. This enrichment stimulates biological activity, resulting in an extensive patch of chlorophyll (360,000 square kilometers). Diazotroph activity is two to eight times higher and carbon export fluxes are two to three times higher in iron-enriched waters than in adjacent unfertilized waters. Such findings reveal a previously undescribed mechanism of natural iron fertilization in the ocean that fuels regional hotspot sinks for atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>.",

TCR activation triggers membrane specialization within the immune synapse, including the production of diacylglycerol (DAG), a lipid that can induce negative membrane curvature. We found that activated TCRs were shed into DAG-enriched ectosomes at the immune synapse rather than internalized through endocytosis, suggesting that DAG may contribute to the outward budding required for ectocytosis. Budding ectosomes were endocytosed directly by target cells, thereby terminating TCR signaling and simultaneously disengaging the CTL from the target cell to allow serial killing.

                "summary":"Moiré multilayers of graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides have been found to host a number of exotic electronic phases. In addition to charge carriers—electrons and holes—these two-dimensional structures support their pairs, called excitons, which are also expected to form correlated phases. Xiong et al. observed a correlated insulator of interlayer excitons in a bilayer consisting of tungsten diselenide, which hosted holes, and tungsten disulfide, which hosted electrons. The researchers measured the optical response of the material to excitation by light and found signatures of an incompressible state of excitons. —Jelena Stajic",
                "abstract":"A panoply of unconventional electronic states has been observed in moiré superlattices. Engineering similar bosonic phases remains, however, largely unexplored. We report the observation of a bosonic correlated insulator in tungsten diselenide/tungsten disulfide (WSe2/WS2) moiré superlattices composed of excitons, that is, tightly bound electron-hole pairs. We develop a pump probe spectroscopy method that we use to observe an exciton incompressible state at exciton filling νex = 1 and charge neutrality, indicating a correlated insulator of excitons. With varying charge density, the bosonic correlated insulator continuously transitions into an electron correlated insulator at charge filling νe = 1, suggesting a mixed correlated insulating state between the two limits. Our studies establish semiconducting moiré superlattices as an intriguing platform for engineering bosonic phases.",

                "summary":"Biodiversity is typically high in mountain ranges, likely because of their history of tectonic activity and wide range of environments from base to peak. Looking closer, however, reveals that mountain diversity often occurs within environments and in ranges that have long ceased being tectonically active. Stokes et al. describe diversification among lineages of a freshwater fish species in the North American Appalachian Mountains driven by an affiliation with metamorphic rock. Specifically, as metamorphic rock wore away and was replaced by other types, greenfin darters were increasingly isolated in upstream reaches where metamorphic rock remained, leading to population separation and allopatric diversification. —Sacha Vignieri",
                "abstract":"The high levels of biodiversity supported by mountains suggest a possible link between geologic processes and biological evolution. Freshwater biodiversity is high not only in tectonically active settings but also in tectonically quiescent montane regions such as the Appalachian Mountains. We show that erosion through different rock types drove allopatric divergence between lineages of the Greenfin Darter (Nothonotus chlorobranchius), a fish species endemic to rivers draining metamorphic rocks in the Tennessee River basin in the United States. In the past, metamorphic rock preferred by N. chlorobranchius was more widespread, but as erosion exposed other rock types, lineages of this species were progressively isolated in tributaries farther upstream, where metamorphic rock remained. Our results suggest a geologic mechanism for initiating allopatric diversification in mountains long after tectonic activity ceases.",

Modern tunicates use these siphons to help filter-feed and have bands of longitudinal muscles running down their bodies as well as circular muscles around the siphons to control them.

They found that within 90 days after a shot, the rate of POTS-related symptoms was about 33% higher than in the 3 months before; 2581 people were diagnosed with POTS-related symptoms after vaccination, compared with 1945 beforehand. However, the study found a bigger effect from COVID-19 itself: The rate of POTS symptoms in about 12,000 unvaccinated people after infection was 52% higher than beforehand. Although Kwan cautions against extrapolating these numbers to a wider population, he says the pattern is intriguing. “Our data show a relatively clear signal that there probably is an increase in POTS after vaccination and after infection,” he says."

One theory is that after vaccination some people generate another round of antibodies targeting the first.

The rogue antibodies might also bind to ACE2, which helps regulate blood pressure and heart rate, says Bernhard Schieffer, a cardiologist at the University of Marburg.

The deadline passed without any response from ODNI, but today it released its declassified information, hours after an initial version of this story was published.

Former President Donald Trump repeatedly blamed the pandemic on the leak of a virus from WIV, and a few days before his administration left, the Department of State issued a fact sheet that said, without offering any proof, it had “reason to believe that several researchers inside the WIV became sick in autumn 2019.”"

Interventions that promote academic persistence also work differently for students from different backgrounds and operate differently across contexts. Walton et al. conducted a randomized controlled trial to systematically explain and understand these heterogenous effects in a brief online intervention across 22 universities and colleges (see the Perspective by Bowman). The intervention was designed to remedy students’ concerns about belonging through a reading-and-writing activity that emphasized how worries about fitting in, struggling in class, and feeling homesick during the college transition are common and improve over time. They found that the intervention improved retention and persistence in school, particularly among historically underrepresented students, when the school context offered students opportunities to belong. The findings have policy implications for academic institutions that strive to better support and retain diverse students. —Ekeoma Uzogara",
                "abstract":"A promising way to mitigate inequality is by addressing students’ worries about belonging. But where and with whom is this social-belonging intervention effective? Here we report a team-science randomized controlled experiment with 26,911 students at 22 diverse institutions. Results showed that the social-belonging intervention, administered online before college (in under 30 minutes), increased the rate at which students completed the first year as full-time students, especially among students in groups that had historically progressed at lower rates. The college context also mattered: The intervention was effective only when students’ groups were afforded opportunities to belong. This study develops methods for understanding how student identities and contexts interact with interventions. It also shows that a low-cost, scalable intervention generalizes its effects to 749 4-year institutions in the United States.",

Feedback processes such as supernova explosions enrich the gas with elements heavier than helium and can impart enough momentum to eject some gas out of the galaxy. S. Zhang et al. observed the intergalactic medium around a massive galaxy at redshift 2.3. In addition to emission lines caused by hydrogen and helium, they observed lines for carbon, indicating that the gas has been enriched with heavier elements. The kinematics are consistent with streams of gas spiraling toward the massive galaxy. The authors propose that the enriched gas has been recycled from an earlier period of star formation. —Keith T. Smith",
                "abstract":"Stars form in galaxies, from gas that has been accreted from the intergalactic medium. Simulations have shown that recycling of gas—the reaccretion of gas that was previously ejected from a galaxy—could sustain star formation in the early Universe. We observe the gas surrounding a massive galaxy at redshift 2.3 and detect emission lines from neutral hydrogen, helium, and ionized carbon that extend 100 kiloparsecs from the galaxy. The kinematics of this circumgalactic gas is consistent with an inspiraling stream. The carbon abundance indicates that the gas had already been enriched with elements heavier than helium, previously ejected from a galaxy. We interpret the results as evidence of gas recycling during high-redshift galaxy assembly.",

Holycross and Cottrell tested this hypothesis by running a series of experiments to determine how garnet formation changes the amount and speciation of iron. They found that garnet does not have a large impact and is unlikely to be the sole cause of the oxidation of arc lavas. The observed chemistry requires a different explanation. —Brent Grocholski",
                "abstract":"Arc magmas, the building blocks of continental crust, are depleted in total iron (Fe), have higher ratios of oxidized Fe to total Fe (Fe3+/∑Fe), and record higher oxygen fugacities (fO2’s) compared with magmas erupted at mid-ocean ridges. Garnet crystallization could explain these observations if garnet removes substantial amounts of Fe<sip>2+</sup>,, but not Fe<sup>3+</sup>, from magma, yet this model for continental crust generation has never been tested experimentally. Analysis of garnets and melts in laboratory experiments show that the compatibilities of Fe<sip>2+</sup> and Fe<sip>3+</sup> in garnet are of similar magnitudes. Our results indicate that fractional crystallization of garnet-bearing cumulates will remove 22 % of total Fe from primary arc basalts but negligibly alter the Fe<sip>3+</sup>/∑Fe ratio and fO2 of the melt. Garnet crystallization is unlikely to be responsible for the relatively oxidized nature of basaltic arc magmas or the Fe-depletion trend observed in continental crust.",

In an artificial spin ice geometry called Santa Fe ice, this frustration can be viewed through the magnetic moment configurations at the vertices of the magnetic array. X. Zhang et al. monitored the kinetics of the strings formed by “unhappy” vertices—those not in their lowest energy state. Using x-ray magnetic circular dichroism photoemission electron microscopy, the researchers took images of the system once a second and analyzed the observed changes in string configurations. The system underwent a crossover between a low-temperature regime with limited string motion to a high-temperature one characterized by changes in string topology. —Jelena Stajic",
                "abstract":"Ergodic kinetics, which are critical to equilibrium thermodynamics, can be constrained by a system’s topology. We studied a model nanomagnetic array in which such constraints visibly affect the behavior of the magnetic moments. In this system, magnetic excitations connect into thermally active one-dimensional strings whose motion can be imaged in real time. At high temperatures, our data showed the merging, breaking, and reconnecting of strings, resulting in the system transitioning between topologically distinct configurations. Below a crossover temperature, the string motion is dominated by simple changes in length and shape. In this low-temperature regime, the system is energetically stable because of its inability to explore all possible topological configurations. This kinetic crossover suggests a generalizable conception of topologically broken ergodicity and limited equilibration.",

To reveal which factor is responsible for this process and to understand the molecular mechanism of stop codon recognition, Saurer et al. used a combination of gene editing, ribosomal profiling and cryo–electron microscopy to investigate the termination process in vivo and in vitro. The specific recognition of the noncanonical stop codon by the identified release factor results in a distortion of the messenger RNA and requires participation of the ribosomal RNA, a recognition mechanism that was not observed for canonical termination complexes. —Di Jiang",

Mitochondrial genomes feature deviations from the standard genetic code, including the reassignment of two arginine codons to stop codons. The protein required for translation termination at these noncanonical stop codons to release the newly synthesized polypeptides is not currently known. In this study, we used gene editing and ribosomal profiling in combination with cryo–electron microscopy to establish that mitochondrial release factor 1 (mtRF1) detects noncanonical stop codons in human mitochondria by a previously unknown mechanism of codon recognition. We discovered that binding of mtRF1 to the decoding center of the ribosome stabilizes a highly unusual conformation in the messenger RNA in which the ribosomal RNA participates in specific recognition of the noncanonical stop codons.",

The reason, Ho explains, is a phenomenon called immunological imprinting, in which repeatedly exposing the immune system to one strain—in this case, the ancestral one—skews the immune response in that direction. When the decision was made to keep the ancestral strain in COVID-19 vaccines, Ho says, imprinting “was probably not a dominant consideration, but it is now.”"

Interventions that promote academic persistence also work differently for students from different backgrounds and operate differently across contexts. Walton et al. conducted a randomized controlled trial to systematically explain and understand these heterogenous effects in a brief online intervention across 22 universities and colleges (see the Perspective by Bowman). The intervention was designed to remedy students’ concerns about belonging through a reading-and-writing activity that emphasized how worries about fitting in, struggling in class, and feeling homesick during the college transition are common and improve over time. They found that the intervention improved retention and persistence in school, particularly among historically underrepresented students, when the school context offered students opportunities to belong. The findings have policy implications for academic institutions that strive to better support and retain diverse students. —Ekeoma Uzogara",

Here we report a team-science randomized controlled experiment with 26,911 students at 22 diverse institutions. Results showed that the social-belonging intervention, administered online before college (in under 30 minutes), increased the rate at which students completed the first year as full-time students, especially among students in groups that had historically progressed at lower rates. The college context also mattered: The intervention was effective only when students’ groups were afforded opportunities to belong. This study develops methods for understanding how student identities and contexts interact with interventions. It also shows that a low-cost, scalable intervention generalizes its effects to 749 4-year institutions in the United States.",

Bonnet et al. found that shallow hydrothermal sources also can supply iron to the surface ocean. They show that fluids emitted along the Tonga volcanic Arc in the South Pacific supply enough iron to the photic layer to stimulate biological activity well above that in adjacent unfertilized waters. —H.

                "abstract":"Iron is an essential nutrient that regulates productivity in ~30% of the ocean. Compared with deep (>2000 meter) hydrothermal activity at mid-ocean ridges that provide iron to the ocean’s interior, shallow (<500 meter) hydrothermal fluids are likely to influence the surface’s ecosystem. However, their effect is unknown. In this work, we show that fluids emitted along the Tonga volcanic arc (South Pacific) have a substantial impact on iron concentrations in the photic layer through vertical diffusion. This enrichment stimulates biological activity, resulting in an extensive patch of chlorophyll (360,000 square kilometers). Diazotroph activity is two to eight times higher and carbon export fluxes are two to three times higher in iron-enriched waters than in adjacent unfertilized waters. Such findings reveal a previously undescribed mechanism of natural iron fertilization in the ocean that fuels regional hotspot sinks for atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>.",

How CTLs terminate signaling and disengage to allow serial killing has remained a mystery. TCR activation triggers membrane specialization within the immune synapse, including the production of diacylglycerol (DAG), a lipid that can induce negative membrane curvature. We found that activated TCRs were shed into DAG-enriched ectosomes at the immune synapse rather than internalized through endocytosis, suggesting that DAG may contribute to the outward budding required for ectocytosis. Budding ectosomes were endocytosed directly by target cells, thereby terminating TCR signaling and simultaneously disengaging the CTL from the target cell to allow serial killing. Thus, ectocytosis renders TCR signaling self-limiting.",

In addition to charge carriers—electrons and holes—these two-dimensional structures support their pairs, called excitons, which are also expected to form correlated phases. Xiong et al. observed a correlated insulator of interlayer excitons in a bilayer consisting of tungsten diselenide, which hosted holes, and tungsten disulfide, which hosted electrons. The researchers measured the optical response of the material to excitation by light and found signatures of an incompressible state of excitons. —Jelena Stajic",

We report the observation of a bosonic correlated insulator in tungsten diselenide/tungsten disulfide (WSe2/WS2) moiré superlattices composed of excitons, that is, tightly bound electron-hole pairs. We develop a pump probe spectroscopy method that we use to observe an exciton incompressible state at exciton filling νex = 1 and charge neutrality, indicating a correlated insulator of excitons. With varying charge density, the bosonic correlated insulator continuously transitions into an electron correlated insulator at charge filling νe = 1, suggesting a mixed correlated insulating state between the two limits. Our studies establish semiconducting moiré superlattices as an intriguing platform for engineering bosonic phases.",

                "summary":"Biodiversity is typically high in mountain ranges, likely because of their history of tectonic activity and wide range of environments from base to peak. Looking closer, however, reveals that mountain diversity often occurs within environments and in ranges that have long ceased being tectonically active. Stokes et al. describe diversification among lineages of a freshwater fish species in the North American Appalachian Mountains driven by an affiliation with metamorphic rock. Specifically, as metamorphic rock wore away and was replaced by other types, greenfin darters were increasingly isolated in upstream reaches where metamorphic rock remained, leading to population separation and allopatric diversification. —Sacha Vignieri",
                "abstract":"The high levels of biodiversity supported by mountains suggest a possible link between geologic processes and biological evolution. Freshwater biodiversity is high not only in tectonically active settings but also in tectonically quiescent montane regions such as the Appalachian Mountains. We show that erosion through different rock types drove allopatric divergence between lineages of the Greenfin Darter (Nothonotus chlorobranchius), a fish species endemic to rivers draining metamorphic rocks in the Tennessee River basin in the United States. In the past, metamorphic rock preferred by N. chlorobranchius was more widespread, but as erosion exposed other rock types, lineages of this species were progressively isolated in tributaries farther upstream, where metamorphic rock remained. Our results suggest a geologic mechanism for initiating allopatric diversification in mountains long after tectonic activity ceases.",
